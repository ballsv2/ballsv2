Version 0.0.1-alpha-pre-pretty-sure

By using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sub-licensing, teleporting, or whispering sweet nothings to this software (henceforth “The Thing”), you agree to the following totally serious and legally binding terms:

1. You may do anything you want with The Thing, including but not limited to: feeding it to ducks, printing it out and making origami swans, or yelling at it during thunderstorms. You do you.

2. If The Thing breaks, explodes, transforms into sentient code, or haunts your dreams, that’s on you. The original author(s) take zero, nada, zilch responsibility.

3. You may attribute credit to yourself, your dog, or the ghost in your machine, as long as you do it with flair.

4. Forking this code requires you to take a solemn oath to never write JavaScript like it's 1999. Unless it's funny.

5. Redistribution is encouraged, especially if done via interpretive dance or pirate radio.

6. No warranty. No refunds. No regrets.
